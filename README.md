# Aniquiz

What we should build:
1. Frontend with basic starting point
2. Backend with something to communicate with AI endpoint yeah

What is **not** hard:
- Making frontend that works
- Connecting the services

What is hard:
- How to abstract the two options into a prompt
- How to consume back the result as an input to the frontends
- How does thread works 
-
